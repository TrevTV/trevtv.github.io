4. In the explorer window that appears, copy the path by right clicking the address bar and press `Copy address as text`
5. In the installer, press the SELECT button in the Automated section.
6. In that selection window, paste the address you copied before into the bar and press enter.
7. Then select `IEYTD.exe` and press Open.
8. The installer should have v0.3.0 selected and auto-detect x86 game arch, if not, set them now, then press `INSTALL`
9. After the installer gives a prompt saying "INSTALL was Successful!" you may close it.
10. Reopen the game's folder, either by using Steam or through the path you copied, and find `version.dll`
11. Once found, rename it to `winhttp.dll` or MelonLoader will not be loaded.
12. Take the files from the downloaded zip (should contain the folders Mods, Plugins, and UserData) and drag them into the explorer window.
13. Start the game through Steam and the MelonLoader console should start and load the mods into the game.
